# The real data does not have the same columns as the demo data. Very annoying!
# Note you can use the n_max argument to read_csv() to just read in the first
# 100 or so rows, thereby quickly getting back the message about the column
# types. Then, we use this new listing of types. Use cache = TRUE so that you
# don't have to repeat long calculations every time you reknit the document.
